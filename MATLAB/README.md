The MATLAB code here allows for the simulation of the saturating controller and for the validation and plot of the experimental results.

run_controller.m:

    Allows for defining parameters and running the saturating controller in simulation.
  
run_controller_debug.m:

    Reads a data.mat file that contains the state of the quad during an experiment, and plots the control torques that should be generated by the saturating controller for each time instant. This allows for checking if the implemented controller is running appropriately.
    
run_with_torques.m:

    Reads a data.mat file obtained from an experiment and runs a simulation of the quad response under the torques that were computed in the experiment. This gives an impression of how close to the model is the actual quad.
